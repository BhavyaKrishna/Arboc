# Arboc
# Areas of implementation:
  •	Underwater surveillance
  
  •	Ship propeller/lower deck inspection.
  
  •	Detecting oil spills in Semi-submersible/Off shore oil drilling platforms. 
# Platforms to develop novel solutions:
  •	Implementing Reinforcement learning for gait generation of the snake robot and to study the optimal gait for goal-based locomotion.
  
  •	Underwater path planning.
  
  •	Optimal control algorithms with feedback from IMUs for snake robots.
# Challenges:
  •	To find an innovative way to wirelessly communicate underwater. If the developed communication system is not robust and unreliable,
  tethers can be used as most underwater surveillance vehicles are tethered.
  
  •	Gait generation and mathematical modelling.
  
  •	Fabrication.
# Progress till date:
  •	Designed/Developed a 3D CAD model of the snake-robot using Autodesk’s Fusion 360.
