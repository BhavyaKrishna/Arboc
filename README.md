Design and Simulation of a Snake robot which is modular and is capable of performing various gaits of a snake.

# Problem Statement
For a country like India where 50% of its population is engaged in agricultural activities, inefficient agricultural practices and inadequate storage facilities can lead to high wastage and quality deterioration of food grains. Thus, being one of the leading countries in agricultural production, India still faces problem of scarcity of food grains. Rats, mice and other rodents have long been a problem on farms where food and nesting sites are plentiful. They are carriers of a number of diseases and are responsible for contaminating farm feed and water supplies causing diseases that are harmful to both livestock and humans.

Consider a scenario where grains are stored in silos after harvest; there are congested and uneven tracks between the silos that are difficult for humans to monitor. This may lead to a rise in rodent attacks and infestation. A biomorphic robot resembling a Snake that is capable of traversing such tracks may be a solution for regular scanning of the warehouse.

This is the challenge we pose in the e-Yantra Robotics Competition (eYRC-2017) in a unique theme titled Spotter Snake. Through this theme, we help you to unleash your imagination and discover your talent in 3D designing to build a biomorphic hyper-redundant snake robot that is capable of traversing an arena representing different terrains. The snake robot has to sense different types of rodents and alert the farmer of their presence. We divide the theme into a number of tasks to build the robot in a step-by-step manner.

Challenges in this theme include: micro-controller programming, 3D design and printing, simulation and joystick designing for wireless communication. Teams may also develop various gaits such as: serpentine, sidewinding and caterpillar.
